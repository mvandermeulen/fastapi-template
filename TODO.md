# TODO List

## User

- ~~Allow user to edit their own data (currently just admin)~~
- ~~Dedicated 'change password' route, only change password of the current logged
  in user.~~
- ~~admin can ban/unban a user.~~
- ~~user can get their own user details~~
- Add certain users that will not time-expire (or much longer time) for eg for
  owner or premium access.
- Replace the `toml`/`toml_w` libraries with `tomlkit` for better functionality.
